Steps To Do:

1. Spread butter or ghee on the bread and toast them until they turn golden on one side and until firm on the other side. 
2. Chop the veggies thinly.
3. Heat oil on a pan, and saute cumin until they crackle. Add garlic and fry until a good smell comes out.
4. Add chopped tomatoes.
5. Sprinkle salt and mix.
6. Cover and cook on a medium heat until it turns completely soft and mushy.
7. Add chilli powder if you need.
8. Add veggies. Saute on a medium flame until they are partially cooked. If carrots are not tender you may cover and cook. Do not saute on a high flame as it gives a smoky flavour.
9. Add Pav Bhaji masala or Garam masala and coriander leaves. Adjust the salt and make sure the veggies are least partially cooked.
10. Place the toasted slices and transfer the veggies over them. If you wish to have cheese, then sprinkle now.
11. Place on another slice of bread. Press down gently. If using cheese, toast it on a low heat without burning until the cheese melts.

Veg Sandwich is ready. Serve hot.
